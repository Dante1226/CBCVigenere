# CBCVigenere
This a modification to the Vigenere that adds a CBC like structure
In this project we use the vigenere cipher, then we add another part to the code where it
pads the message to the multiples of the key length so it can encrypt perfectly, but when the message 
it randomly adds uppercase letters to have the random factor on to it.
